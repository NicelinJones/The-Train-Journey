                John told hid dad,"No problem, Dad I will manage.
                Now i am 11 yearSs old and I can travel alone by train. Please allow me to go alone".

            <p>
                It was day of travel. John woke up early in the morning, got ready, and headed to the railway station.
                His father and mother came to see him off. Before he left, his father gave him a piece of paper and said, "if you feel scared, read this papper".
                John put the paper in his bag, said goodbye to his parents, and sat down on the train.

            <p>
                After 10 minutes some people asked him,"why are you traveling alone?".
                John replied "i am a big boy, so I am going to my grandpa's house alone".
                After some time, a ticket checker came and asked him the same question. 
                John gave the same answer, but he began to feel a little scared.
                At that moment, he remembered the papper his father had gave him.
                 So he took the papper out of his bag and read it.
                when he read the papper  he was surprised and felt strong in his mind because his father had written, "John you don't have to  worry.
                I am in the last compartment of the train. We didn't go home, we came with you on the train".
                John was so happy. He forgot his fear and felt good about the journey. That year, he also enjoyed his time at his grandparent's house.
            </p>
            
                <h3>The Moral</h3>
                <p>In this story, John traveled alone by train. When he felt fear, he read the papper his father had given him.
                It reminded him that was not truly alone. His father's love and care were with him the entire time.
                Likewise, our Heavenly father also loves and cares for us all. 
                To show His love, He send his only Son, Jesus, into the world.
                God never leaves us alone, even in difficult times in life, because Jesus said, "I am with you always,even to the end of the world".
                </p>
                <blockquote>"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you: and, lo, i am with you alway,even unto the end of the World<br/> 
                                                                       Matthew 28:20"
                                                                       </blockquote>
