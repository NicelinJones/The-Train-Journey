            <p>
                After 10 minutes some people asked him,"why were you going alone".
                John replied "i am a big boy so i am going to my grandpa house alone"

                But he got some fear in mind.At that time he remembered the papper that was given by his dad.So he taken the papper out side and read it.
                when he read the papper  he was surprised and got strength in mind .Because in that papper daddy told "john you don't worry, i am here in last compartment of train, we didnt go to home, we also came with you in train".
                John was very happy he forgot the fear and feel good to journey now.That year also he enjoyed in grandparent house.
            </p>
            
                <h3>The Moral</h3>
                <p>In this story john travelled by train alone. When he got fear he read the papper that was given by his father.
                    So he know that he was not travelling alone. His father never leaved him alone because of his love and care.
                     Like wise our heavenly father also have more love and care all the peoples. 
                     So our heavenly father send his only son name Jesus to the world.
                     God never allowed us to feel fear in difficulties in the life journey.
                     because Jesus said i am with you in every days.
    

            </p>"Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you: and, lo, i am with you alway,even unto the end of the World<br/> 
                                                                       Matthew 28:20"
